	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06319},
	abstract = {We describe a general purpose digital servo optimized for feedback control of lasers in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics experiments. The servo is capable of feedback bandwidths up to roughly 1{\textasciitilde}MHz (limited by the 320{\textasciitilde}ns total latency); loop filter shapes up to fifth order; multiple-input, multiple-output control; and automatic lock acquisition. The configuration of the servo is controlled via a graphical user interface, which also provides a rudimentary software oscilloscope and tools for measurement of system transfer functions. We illustrate the functionality of the digital servo by describing its use in two example scenarios: frequency control of the laser used to probe the narrow clock transition of \${\textasciicircum}\{27\}\$Al\${\textasciicircum}+\$ in an optical atomic clock, and length control of a cavity used for resonant frequency doubling of a laser.},
